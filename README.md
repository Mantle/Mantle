# Mantle

Mantle makes it easy to write a simple model layer for your Cocoa or Cocoa Touch application.

This framework is very much a work in progress at the moment, and should be considered **alpha quality**. Breaking changes may happen often during this time.

## Getting Started

To start building the framework, clone this repository and then run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This will automatically pull down any dependencies.

Once you have the code, check out [MTLModel](https://github.com/github/Mantle/blob/master/Mantle/MTLModel.h). `MTLModel` is intended to be a powerful base class for your model objects, and comprises a large part of the framework's utility.

## Foundation Additions

Even without `MTLModel`, the framework contains general conveniences to support creating and using a model layer. Check out the documentation in category headers for more information.

## Contributing

Fork this repository, make it awesomer (preferably in a branch named for the topic), send a pull request!
